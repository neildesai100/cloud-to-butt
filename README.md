corona-to-üÖ±Ô∏èorona
=============

![](logo.png)

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'coronavirus' with 'üÖ±Ô∏èoronavirus'.

Installation
------------

Download the 'CoronaToBorona.crx' file (from the list above). In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag CoronaToBorona.crx into the page that appears.

Why
------------
Reading a hundred articles a day about the ongoing global pandemic is enough to give anyone anxiety. Even if you don't go out of your way to read up on it, social media is flooded with people talking about it. A lot of people are scared (and with some good reason) but beyond motivating us to engage in best health/safety practices, fear is dangerous. Discussing this issue with a friend over spring break, I realized that it was literally impossible to feel scared if you referred to the virus as üÖ±Ô∏èoronavirus.
